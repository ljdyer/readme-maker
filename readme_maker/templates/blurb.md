I am a programmer and linguist with several years' experience developing applications to support translation work in the IT industry. I am currently enrolled in the <a href="https://www.wlv.ac.uk/courses/ma-computational-linguistics/">MA Computational Linguistics</a> course at the University of Wolverhampton, and some of the projects below are related to content I have studied during the course. Projects I have worked on as an employee of my current and previous companies are not included in this public GitHub for intellectual property reasons, but some of the productivity tools below are currently used by teams of professional translators.

My main technical interests are natural language processing, machine learning, and computer-aided translation. I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic for Applications, HTML, and CSS and have experience coding in R, Java, PHP, MATLAB, and Groovy.
